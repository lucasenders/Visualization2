            Coal emissions have been a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions throughout 
            Australia's history, remaining the largest contributor for much of that time. However, 
            starting in the 1960s, oil began to emerge as a prominent source of emissions, growing 
            steadily and reaching levels comparable to those of coal today. Meanwhile, gas did not 
            gain prominence until the 1990s, but it has shown consistent growth since then. Overall, 
            Australia's emissions remained relatively stagnant from 1900 until the mid-1930s, after 
            which substantial growth occurred until around 2010, when emissions plateaued. Recently, 
            there have been signs of a declining trend, indicating a potential shift towards more 
            sustainable practices in the country's energy landscape.</p>

            The Northern Territory has consistently led Australia in per capita CO₂ emissions from 1990 
            to 2022, with the exception of 2012, when Queensland was the highest emitter. Typically, 
            Queensland and Western Australia rank second and third, respectively, followed by New South 
            Wales and Victoria. Notably, since 2015, both New South Wales and Victoria have reduced their 
            emissions, currently averaging around 14 and 13 tonnes per capita, respectively. Tasmania has 
            made the most significant strides, decreasing emissions from over 40 tonnes per capita in 1990 
            to below zero in 2014, maintaining this trend thereafter. These patterns underscore the diverse 
            progress among Australian states in reducing CO₂ emissions over the past decades.

            When examining total CO₂ emissions, Australia doesn't appear too concerning, emitting far less 
            than major contributors like China, the USA, and India, and ranking similarly to the United Kingdom 
            and France. However, on a per capita basis, Australia is one of the worst performers globally, 
            emitting as much as the USA and far more than China, the UK, and France. This stark contrast 
            highlights the significant work Australia must undertake to address its emissions on an individual 
            level and ensure meaningful progress in reducing its carbon footprint. Explore the map below to 
            compare CO₂ emissions per capita across different countries and see how Australia measures up globally
          through the years.</p>

            The global landscape of CO2 emissions has shifted dramatically over the past century. From about 1900 to 1960, Europe and North America were the primary contributors, accounting for nearly 97% of emissions in 1990. However, since 1960, their combined share has declined to just over 31% in 2022. In contrast, Asia's emissions have surged from just over 2% in 1900 to over 60% today, reflecting a significant transfer of production and industrial activity to the region driven by globalization. Throughout this period, South America and Africa have remained relatively minor contributors to global emissions, indicating their slower development compared to Europe, Asia, and North America. Oceania has also contributed insignificantly, likely due to its smaller population. These trends highlight a significant transformation in global emissions patterns and the economic dynamics that drive them.

            The sources of emissions vary widely across regions, reflecting their distinct energy profiles and industrial activities. In Oceania, the majority of emissions come from oil and coal, followed closely by natural gas, while Africa shows a similar distribution but with a notable portion stemming from cement production. Asia's emissions are predominantly coal, accounting for over 56%. The European Union relies mainly on oil for nearly 45% of its emissions, with gas and coal combining for around 50%. Other European countries have a higher reliance on gas, making up almost 45%. In North America, oil and gas together comprise over 80% of emissions, whereas South America sources nearly 60% from oil and about 23% from gas, with coal contributing much less. These variations in emissions sources underscore the diverse energy landscapes and economic activities across different regions.
